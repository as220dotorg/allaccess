    <blockquote>
      <p>“As young creatives in the Hip-Hop world, it’s tough to find a venue that works with us to get our vision across to the people. Finding AS220 has been an absolute blessing. Since joining the AS220 family, The Daily Note has taken part in a plethora of AS220 community shows … This may seem like AS220 is just a venue, in its simplest form, but we used the word “family” for a reason. Every time we step away from an event at AS220, whether we curated it or not, there's this rejuvenated energy of acceptance and we sleep well with thoughts like: “Wow, this is why we do what we do.” We’re absolutely grateful they’re in our lives and we know the feeling is reciprocated!”</p>
      <cite>Louie and Cøøg from The Daily Note 401, AS220 Community Curators and local hip-hop artists</cite>

      <p>“It’s incredible for our youth poets to have a space that’s always all-ages, youth centered and rooted in the heart of Providence. We constantly hear from touring artists about what a uniquely perfect space AS220 is, and how badly they wished for some equivalent in their own city.”</p>
      <cite>Muggs Fogarty, Co-Director of the Providence Poetry Slam</cite>
