    <p>The Paul Krot Community Darkroom was established in 1994 and is now <b>one of the only publicly accessible darkrooms</b> in New England. Our darkroom was named after beloved former Rhode Island School of Design photography professor Paul Krot, who also invented Sprint Systems of Photography’s photographic chemistry. The Darkroom - housed on the second floor of Empire Street - allows photographers to print traditional black and white photography, and is also used by AS220 Youth members wanting to learn the magic of darkroom photography. In fiscal year 2017, there were <b>211 darkroom reservations</b> made and <b>40 workshops</b> held for the public.</p>

    <p>The Darkroom falls under the broader umbrella of AS220 Industries, a collection of community work studios offering affordable resources and educational experiences in a variety of artistic disciplines, including printmaking, digital fabrication, photography and media arts. Located in our Mercantile Building, the Industries serves approximately <b>200 active members</b> each year.  In fiscal year 2017, <b>393 students</b> participated in <b>107 workshops</b> throughout the Industries.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“The Paul Krot Community Darkroom at AS220 is truly a one-of-a-kind resource in Rhode Island. Having affordable access to a professionally equipped facility, and the shared knowledge of the multi-generational and multi-cultural community of users it houses, allows myself and other film photographers to grow in our practice at a time when many are leaving traditional film photography due to the lack of access to such resources. The presence of a darkroom at AS220 ensures there will continue to be a thriving community of photographers of all ages and backgrounds centered in Providence.”</p>
