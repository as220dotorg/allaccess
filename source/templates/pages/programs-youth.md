    <p>AS220 Youth is a <b>nationally recognized</b>, <b>award-winning</b> after-school educational program and creative incubator for young people, ages 14-21, many of whom are at- and beyond-risk. The program harnesses comprehensive arts education and technical training, career building, hip hop, and social justice education to affect change for youth and their communities. Today, the program <b>serves 600 youth annually</b>, the majority of whom are young people of color. AS220 Youth provides support year-round through after-school classes and mentoring in performance, visual arts, music, apparel design, and media. In fiscal year 2017, we offered <b>865 art classes</b> at four sites: our Empire Street Studio; the Rhode Island Training School: the state's juvenile detention facility; the Urban Collaborative Accelerated Program: an alternative middle school for those at high risk of drop out; and Skip Nowell Academy: a charter high school serving pregnant and parenting teens. Since 2015, AS220 Youth's guiding pedagogy has evolved through the collaborative visioning and creation of <b>Futureworlds</b>, a youth-led arts showcase and research project striving toward a world free from today's systems of oppression. Anjel Newmann, AS220 Youth Director, says: “Futureworlds gives  young people the space and resources to create highly visible work that <b>transforms</b> the way we think about <b>art, community and justice</b>.”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“I have been fortunate enough to see the importance and the power of art. My parents died when I was young. My younger sister passed away tragically. I spent a lot of my youth in the system, so I wasn't a very trusting person. I wasn't used to people caring, period. Learning the meaning of community was important. Once I learned that, I wanted not only to be a part of it, I wanted to protect it, nurture it and give others the opportunities I never had. Working with AS220 Youth has been the biggest blessing. I'm on the front lines making a difference. I'm an artist, this is true, but teaching has helped me become a better man, father, and friend.”</p>
