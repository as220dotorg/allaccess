    <p>In keeping with AS220’s mission to provide an unjuried, uncensored, all-ages forum for artists, AS220’s Galleries program extends the opportunity to exhibit original creative work to <b>every resident of Rhode Island</b>. The demand for exhibition space is so high there is a four year waiting list to exhibit in our Project Space Gallery on Mathewson Street. AS220 strives to <b>reduce barriers to creative expression</b> for Rhode Islanders and, as such, it is free for artists to exhibit in our gallery spaces.</p>

    <p>Empire Street houses our Main Gallery, which is also our Main Stage, and has a 1.5-2 year waiting list for a month-long exhibition. The building also holds our Open Window Gallery, which will be expanded throughout the restaurant space; the Youth Gallery; and the currently underutilized Aborn Gallery, which building improvements will ensure becomes publicly accessible. In fiscal year 2017, AS220 presented 33 exhibitions in our Empire Street gallery spaces that showcased <b>83</b> artists, <b>51</b> of which were first-time exhibitors. Estimated attendance was <b>6,100</b>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Having a show in AS220’s Main Gallery helps me set goals and stretch. Knowing that my work will be up on the walls in a place that gets seen is highly motivating and is a critical part of moving my creative practice forward. The context at AS220 is ideal; it’s professional and also totally genuine. Showing at AS220 has allowed me make connections with new people that are about my art.”</p>
