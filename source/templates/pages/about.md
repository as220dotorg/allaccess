    <h3>What is AS220?</h3>

    <p>AS220 is a not-for-profit community arts organization located in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. Our mission to provide “a local forum and home for the arts through the maintenance of residential and work studios, galleries, performance and educational spaces” remains as relevant and vital today as it was when AS220 was founded in 1985. True to our origins, our performance spaces remain unjuried, uncensored and all ages: they are spaces to come together, collaborate, innovate, experiment and take risks. AS220 cultivates a creative community that continues to have a profoundly transformative impact on the city of Providence. We are dedicated to supporting artists and enhancing the cultural opportunities for all the people of Rhode Island.</p>

    <p>AS220 provides artists opportunities to live, work, exhibit and perform in our three facilities, which include: four rotating gallery spaces; a performance stage; a black box theater; a print shop; a darkroom and media arts lab; a fabrication and electronics lab; a dance studio; a youth program focusing on youth under state care and in the Rhode Island juvenile detention facility; 47 affordable residential apartments and 7 work studios for artists; and a bar and restaurant. In an uncertain social and political environment, AS220 has become an even more critical forum for people to convene, share, and celebrate the humanity in each other.</p>

    <blockquote>
       <p>“AS220 develops pathways for the city’s creative workforce to nurture entrepreneurial projects, incubate collaborative institutions, and cultivate innovative approaches. Quite simply, the organization has revolutionized the ways that artists in Providence develop and access spaces to be creative.”</p>
       <p>&mdash; Stephanie Fortunato, Director, Department of Art, Culture + Tourism at the City of Providence</p>
