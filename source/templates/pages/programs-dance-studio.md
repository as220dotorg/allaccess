    <blockquote>
      <p>“AS220’s Dance Studio is where I finally found the feeling of being an artist who moves and is present (and not just someone taking a class). It was completely different from other dance studios – it not only welcomed adults with diverse bodies and experiences (in dance training and otherwise) – but was also a place where teachers and students experimented freely. It is where I first met and continue to work with many of the most important artists in my life.”</p>
