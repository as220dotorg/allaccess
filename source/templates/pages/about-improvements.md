        <li><strong>Improve the common living facilities</strong> on the third floor, ensuring they are ADA accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>install an elevator</strong> in the building, thus making all of our Empire Street spaces fully accessible for the first time in the building’s history. </li>
        <li><strong>Create a secure stage loading area</strong> that allows performers to safely leave equipment unattended. </li>
        <li><strong>Create a gender neutral bathroom</strong> on the ground floor to ensure we are accessible and inclusive. </li>
        <li><strong>Reconfigure AS220 Foo(d) and Bar</strong> by moving the kitchen to the back of the building and combining service points.

        <li><strong>Create a ‘stage right exit’</strong> in the Black Box Theater, allowing for the more effective staging of theatre productions. </li>
        <li><strong>Create new storage space</strong> for Black Box risers and seating to enhance the flexibility of the theatre space. </li>
        <li><strong>Improve sound attenuation</strong> between the Black Box Theatre, Psychic Readings Performance Space, and Dance Studio, creating more opportunities for artists and community groups to program spaces. </li>
