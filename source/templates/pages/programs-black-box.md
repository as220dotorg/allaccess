    <blockquote>
      <p>“The Manton Avenue Project has really benefited from being a resident company of AS220's Black Box Theatre. The intimacy of the space really supports the work of our young playwrights, and the downtown location makes our shows accessible to parents, families, and local artists. Having an affordable and accessible space to call our own for the week of our shows means that our young people really get to take ownership over the entire process. AS220's Black Box Theatre has improved the quality of our shows.”</p>
